TO DO
'Programming the main  menu..... but also trying to make it load other menu's
which the user selects..... trying to do this by just changing the 'main'
syntax so it loads different menu types...... not sure what to do with anything
else....

might consider just having one page of menu's with everything on it... but feel
this will be cluttered and not so intuitive for a user to use.

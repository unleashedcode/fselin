TITLE: FSELIN
        Written By, UnleashedCode Software

OVERVIEW:
    This program is to let users engage with FLight Sim Economy and get data by
    scraping the website. The idea is that they have a linux interface and it
    uses the command line. This allows users to set this up on raspberry pi's
    or use over a network *ssh and be able to access information as they fly

CONTEXT:
    Primary reason for this software is an excersize in coding in Python
    Secondary reasons is that I have Raspberry Pi's lying about that need a
    purpose. 

    It will benfit users who only have one monitor or users that have a spare
    raspberry pi who want to get data as they fly
    The website is very cumbersome to use so I want this to be a fast,
    lightweight program which uses little resources but also displays the
    information cleanly without the requirement of a GUI... Allowing for this
    to be used over a network via telnet or ssh

GOALS:
    Use a CLI GUI system which will allow for clean representation of the
    information. Allow easily users to interact with the information. Prevent
    users from making mistakes or having to learn commands to use the program.

    Cover The Basic informtion first and slowly to implement further
    developments of FSEconomy into the program on a requirement bases. Priority
    will be given to functionality over features

    To upload changes regularly to the code on github and allow 
    devs to modify the code.
